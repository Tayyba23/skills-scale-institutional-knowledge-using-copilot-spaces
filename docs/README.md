# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme applies a structured and iterative approach to project management designed to maximize customer value, ensure delivery confidence, and foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement. Our process guides projects through clear phases—initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective—with each stage supported by defined roles, templates, and review points. Project Managers and Product Managers play distinct but collaborative roles to keep efforts aligned, cross-functional teams mobilized, and stakeholders informed. Every project is launched with a lightweight one-pager capturing the problem, goal, stakeholder alignment, and measurable success criteria before detailed planning and delivery begin.

Key workflows emphasize breaking down deliverables into actionable increments, maintaining a prioritized backlog, and running regular planning, review, and retrospective ceremonies. Daily standups and weekly syncs surface progress, blockers, and risks for timely triage. Project boards (e.g., GitHub Projects) visually track work from backlog to completion, supporting transparency and accountability.

Communication is frequent, multi-layered, and always documented: regular status updates keep teams and stakeholders in sync; templated reports, risk registers, and stakeholder briefings ensure all parties are aware of priorities, risks, and decisions. Blocker escalation paths are clearly defined, so issues can be rapidly resolved or elevated as needed.

Quality assurance is integral at every phase. Automated and manual tests are expected for all features, with CI pipelines enforcing code quality and security. All work meets documented acceptance criteria and definitions of done, and releases follow a gated checklist including testing, release notes, and rollback plans. After each milestone or incident, the team runs retrospectives to capture lessons learned and drive actionable improvements, reinforcing OctoAcme’s commitment to operational excellence and transparency.
